Description: # PyPI - lennoxs30api
        ### API Wrapper for www.lennoxicomfort.com
        
        By Pete Sage ()  
        
        Note:  I'm working on a major refactor of this module and a push to PyPI.
        
        This asyncio module connects to the Lennox Cloud API to retrieve data from S30 / E30 thermostats.  This API does not work for older models that use a different API.  Those models are
        supported by this project:  https://github.com/thevoltagesource/myicomfort
        
        
        This module is currently in test and prototype mode; as such it is not recommended at this time to build an application on-top of the API, as the API may change.
        
        This module provides a command line test program; that can be used to exercise the main functions and create diagnostic output files to futher enhance and fix issues with the API
        
        Current state - Tested with a single Zone S30 Air Conditioning System
        
        Known Issues - Passwords with & will not work.
        
        Prerequistes:
        
        1. Python version 3.8.6 or later
        
        2. A Lennox sign-on (email address and password)
        
        3. You may need to install aiohttp https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/
        
        Install Instructions:
        
        1. Grab the repo
        
        2. Edit the test_async.py program to supply the following
         
            LOG_PATH = '/home/pete/lennoxs30api'    #  Directoy to stash the log file in
        
            EMAIL_ADDRESS = 'myemail@myemail.com'
        
            PASSWORD = 'mypassword'
        
        Command Line Program Instructions:
        
        The command line program uses asyncio and runs 3 different tasks
        
        - Task 1 (runner) - this task connects to the cloud API and periodically polls it at a 10 second interval
        
        - Task 2 (poller) - this task runs on a 15 second interval and prints out information from all active Zones
        
        - Task 3 (prompt) - this task reads from the command line and executes commands on behalf of the user to enabling API testing.  Cmd List
        
                cool, heat, off - sets the HVAC mode to cool, heat or off.  usage - just type the word followed by enter eg cool
        
                auto, on, circulate - sets the Fan mocde to auto, on, or ciruclate
        
                csp <TempF> - sets the cool setpoint in F.  example  csp 76
        
                hsp <TempF> - sets the heat setpoint in F.  example hsp 65
        
        To exit the program hit crtl-c
